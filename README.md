## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
```bash
cd tria-contact-app
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm start
```

The app will automatically open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Other Available Scripts

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Eject from Create React App (not recommended)
npm run eject
```

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Drag and drop the `build` folder to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

Or use Netlify CLI:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Component Architecture
- **Functional Components**: Used functional components with hooks for modern React best practices
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Props-based Communication**: Parent-to-child data flow via props, child-to-parent via callbacks
- **Reusable Components**: Components like `ContactCard` are reusable and self-contained

### State Management
- **Local State**: Used `useState` for simple, component-level state
- **No Redux/Context**: Kept state management simple as required
- **Derived State**: Search filtering computed in `useEffect` for efficiency

### Styling Approach
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid, consistent styling
- **Custom Animations**: Added custom keyframe animations in Tailwind config
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts
- **Color Scheme**: Modern gradient backgrounds with blue/purple theme

### UX Features
- **Loading States**: 1.5s simulated fetch to demonstrate async handling
- **Empty States**: Clear messaging when no contacts exist or match search
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive success feedback
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for better user experience

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Simulated API Fetch
```javascript
// Simulates async data fetching with setTimeout
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchContacts = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    setTimeout(() => {
      setContacts(contactsData);
      setFilteredContacts(contactsData);
      setLoading(false);
    }, 1500);
  };
  fetchContacts();
}, []);
```

### Real-time Search Filtering
```javascript
// Case-insensitive, real-time filtering
useEffect(() => {
  if (searchQuery.trim() === '') {
    setFilteredContacts(contacts);
  } else {
    const filtered = contacts.filter((contact) =>
      contact.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
    );
    setFilteredContacts(filtered);
  }
}, [searchQuery, contacts]);
```

### Form Validation
- Non-empty field validation
- Email format validation with regex
- Real-time error clearing on input
- Visual error indicators

## 📝 Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions
- Contacts are identified by unique IDs
- Email format validation is basic (regex-based)
- Phone numbers accept any format (no strict validation)
- Data persistence is client-side only (no backend)

### Limitations
- No actual backend/database integration
- No contact editing feature (only add and delete)
- No persistent storage (data resets on page refresh)
- Search only filters by name (not email/phone)
- Toast notifications auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Undo delete only works for the most recent deletion
- Contact insights update in real-time (no historical data)

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

**Already Implemented:**
- ✅ Delete contact functionality with undo
- ✅ Favorite/starred contacts (sorted first)
- ✅ Contact insights and analytics

**Potential Future Additions:**
- Edit contact functionality
- Multiple search fields (email, phone)
- Contact categories/groups
- Import/export contacts (CSV)
- Backend API integration
- LocalStorage persistence
- Contact avatars/photos (currently using initials)
- Advanced filtering options
- Pagination for large contact lists
- Bulk operations (delete multiple, favorite multiple)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Minor: npm audit shows some vulnerabilities in dependencies (inherited from Create React App)
  - These are development dependencies and don't affect production build
  - Can be addressed by migrating to a more modern build tool in future

## 👨‍💻 Development Notes

### Why Create React App?
- As requested, avoided Vite for this assignment
- CRA provides a stable, webpack-based setup
- Industry-standard for React applications
- Zero configuration required

### Code Quality
- Well-commented code explaining component logic
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper prop handling and validation
- Clean separation of concerns
